“I was born in an empty sea, My tears created oceans 
Producing tsunami waves with emotions 
Patrolling the open seas of an unknown galaxy 
I was floating in front of who I am physically 
Spiritually paralyzing mind body and soul 
It gives me energy when I’m lyrically exercising 
I gotta spit ‘til the story is told in a dream by celestial bodies 
Follow me baby”
