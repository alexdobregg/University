* src:
    * common:
        * Constants:
            This is a class containing all the constants i used in my
            implementation.
    * input:
        * ConsumerInput:
            This is a class whose object contains all the information necessary
            about a consumer.
        * Contract:
            This is a class whose object contains all the information necessary
            about a contract.
        * CostsChanges:
            This is a class whose object contains all the information necessary
            about the costs changes that occur every month.
        * DistributorInput:
            This is a class whose object contains all the information necessary
            about a distributor
        * Input:
            This is a class in whose object the information from the input file
            is stored.
        * InputLoader:
            This is a class that contains a method called readData. It is made for
            reading the data stored in the input file.
    * output:
        * OutputConsumer:
            This is a class containing the fields that are important about a
            consumer and must be written in the output file.
        * OutputDistributor:
            This is a class containing the fields that are important about a
            distributor and must be written in the output file.
        * Writer:
            This is class that creates an ObjectMapper and writes in the
            output file.
    * turns:
        * Turns:
            This is an interface that has a method called computeTurns
        * FirstTurn:
            This is a class that implements the Turns interface, defining
            its own implementation for the computeTurns, preparing
            everything for the next turns, like computing the prices
            of a distributor, creating contracts, consumers and
            distributors being paid and paying their costs and contract
            prices.
        * OtherTurns:
            This is a class that implements the Turns interface, defining
            its own implementation for the computeTurns, only this time,
            the actions repeat themselves for number of turns times. As
            well as the other class called FirstTurn, it calculates the
            prices, makes the changes that occur every month, creates
            new contracts, removes contracts that are ending or contracts
            that belong to bankrupt consumers.
        * TurnsFactory:
            This is a class that is both Singleton and factory. Only one
            instance of this class can be created, and it returns, based
            on what type it receives as an input, one new object of the
            classes that implements the Turns interface.
    * Main:
        This is a class used as an entry point for the program, where new
        objects are created, methods from these objects are called, where
        the the fields of the output consumers and distributors are set.
