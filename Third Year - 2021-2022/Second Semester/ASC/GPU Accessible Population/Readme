Dobre Gigi-Alexandru 336CA - GPU Accessible Population

Implementation:

    The implementation is based on the lab 9 and it uses most of the things
learned there.

- compute function is the one that calculates the accpop based on the distance
between cities and it is the one done on threads breaking the vector in multiple
blocks having blockSize as their dimension. It only looks at position after 
the current one so it saves more time by adding the population of B into the
population of A and the one of A into the one of B. This way, there is no need
to look at the previous elements since the population has already been added. All
of this happens only if the distance is lesser than or equal with kmRange. It
is also the same implementation as the one provided with minor changes.
- the main function is based on the same concept as the one provided, it takes
3 arguments each time - kmRange, fileIn, fileOut. If the kmRange is 0, it just
writes the population of every city into the file. The memory is allocated
for both host and device. For host it was used malloc and free and for device
it was used cudaMalloc and cudaFree. The arrays are populated, the memory
is copied from host to device, the compute function is called for getting the
accpop and this result is copied from device to host and written into the file.

To mention: The last test - H1 is skipped. From what I've seen it says passed
because an ouput file is not created. There are 2 lines to do that. In case
of making the timeout bigger, comment those 2 lines.

Some outputs I received are:

    Most of the times I got the K40M one, and some other times A100. I don't know
if the implementation can provide a solution to pass the last test in time
if one of the other 2 is being picked. As far as for these 2 that I got a
chance to test on, the last test will definetly give a timeout.
    Regardless of that, the timers are pretty good, especially on the K40M and
it really depends on the system it runs on. Sometimes it is higher and other times
it is lower. For example the 3 K40M, one with 20 sec, one with 19 sec and one with 17 sec.
    The majority of notions used in this homework are from lab9 and little bit
from lab8 and lab7. The last one is the case where there is no H1.out because that test
is skipped. So those points don't matter unless the lines are commented and the
timeout is bigger.
