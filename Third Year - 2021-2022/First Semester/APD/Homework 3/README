Tema 3 APD - Dobre Gigi-Alexandru

open_read
    * opens the file and reads the information according to the coordinator
    given as a parameter. It returns the workers array.

printing
    * prints at stdout the complete topology

sendToWorker
    * sends the topology from a coordinator to his workers.

rel01
    * this is divided in 4 ifs - for rank0, rank1, rank2 which are coordinators,
    and for the workers. In the ones for the coordinators, they open their file,
    read the number of workers and the workers and send their topology between 
    each other. After receiving it, they print it and then send it to their
    workers.
    * in addition to this, which is common for all 3 of them, the first one
    will create the vector which has the values equal to the positions. This 
    vector is being sent to the other 2 coordinators and a subvector is sent to his
    workers. Both of them are going to receive it and send it to their workers.
    * these 2 coordinators will receive the modified vector from their workers,
    and will send it to coordinator 0. The rank0 will also receive modified
    vectors from his workers, then he will compute the final one and print it.
    * the other ranks - they will receive the rank that is their coordinator first.
    After, they will receive the topology and print it. Then they will receive 
    the subvector and its dimension in order to double the values. At last,
    they are sending it to their coordinator.
